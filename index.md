On this page I would like to share some works made by me. You can find my resume [here](https://spb.hh.ru/resume/03d9e35dff096d7a650039ed1f4e4e39726f7a?hhtmFrom=account_login)

List of projects:

- NYSE data dashboard

- Customer Churn Prediction

- ETL pipeline

- Cohort Analysis & simple dataviz

- Credit Default Scoring (Hypothesis Testing)

- Spread Widening prediction

- SQL scripts collection

### NYSE data Dashboard

Within this work I've  done some basic exploratory data analysis, the main purpose of it was to make me familiar with the Dash library. The dashboard itself can be found [here](https://nyse-data.herokuapp.com/) it is fully interactive, you can hover over each graph in order to see the details, you can also zoom into details (view more navigation buttons in the upper right angle)

### Customer Churn Prediction

[Here](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/churn-analysis.ipynb) I've done some basic EDA, the main purpose: to create efficient model to predict churn of the client given some parameters. I've also planned to build a web app (via streamlit) to make it easy to make predictions specially for the part of audience that doesn't have a configured jupyter notebook at hand. Via this work I demonstrate the abilty not only to build but also a fine tune a ML model with optuna package.

### ETL pipeline

[This](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/etl.ipynb) is not a full-scale work. Via this script I would like to demonstrate the fact that I have an experience of working with databases, in order to make this working I've created a locally running database, which can be accessed remotely (when I start a ngrok tunnel on my local machine). I've also wanted to show that I'm able to load any given table into a relational database.

### Cohort Analysis and Dataviz

[Here](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/Case6.ipynb) I've made an attempt to visualize some basic info that was available. I've also wanted to show that I'm familiar with pandas groupby  method, and using it to make plots.

### Credit Default Scoring (Hypothesis Testing)

In [this](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/credit_score_default.ipynb) script written in R, I've done some exploratory data analysis and tested hypothesis concerning default, i.e. how does presence in certain social category (sex, marriage, education level) impact the returning of credit, and also answered the question if the mean credit limit differs for default and non-default groups.

### Spread Widening Prediction

In a [first](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/orderbook.ipynb) script I've implemented a simple animated order book (much of the code is redundant, watch the result in the end of the file). In a [second](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/tz8kn98d.ipynb) â€“ tried to build a model which would predict if the spread becomes wider or not. In ordere to do so, i needed to deal with extremely imbalanced dataset.

### SQL scripts

Here are some SQL scripts, written by me.

- [Basic SQL](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/basic_sql.ipynb)

- [Script 1](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/script1.sql)

- [Script 2](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/script2.sql)

- [Script 3](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/script3.sql)

- [Script 4](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/script4.sql)

- [Script 5](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/script5.sql)

- And [here](https://github.com/yukontaf/projects/blob/master/tables.ipynb) is a notebook where you can see the tables to which these queries are made (except for the first)
